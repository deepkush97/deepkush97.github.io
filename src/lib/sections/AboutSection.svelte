		I would describe myself as a <Emphasize>team player</Emphasize> and <Emphasize
			>solution-driven</Emphasize
		> software engineer with <Emphasize>over three years</Emphasize> of experience, working with great
		mentors and personalities
		<Emphasize>(lucky me)</Emphasize> and I hold <Emphasize
			>Bachelor's of Engineering in Computer Engineering</Emphasize
		>.
	</p>
	<p>
		I've already contributed to over a half dozen company projects and assisted with many tough
		issues with my <Emphasize>diagnostic and observative thinking</Emphasize>. Something I like to
		enjoy the most in my experience is <Emphasize
			>deducing the complex problems and requirements
		</Emphasize>and strategize to make a beautiful and well architected solutions which can be
		utilized with easy extendibility.
	</p>
	<p>
		And over the past years, I worked on several projects using
		<Emphasize>C#, Node.js, React.js, Typescript</Emphasize>
		and recently started <Emphasize>Java</Emphasize>. Acquiring a new technology and able to connect
		and work with the existing codebase with good technical understanding and astonished about the
		concepts and knowledge used, is like a dopamine rush to me.
	</p>
	<p>
		I believe my experience has allowed me to hone my <Emphasize>attention to detail</Emphasize>
		and <Emphasize>critical thinking skills</Emphasize> as well as enhance my communication skills working
		on team-based projects.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm always excited to collaborate and apply my technical skills to develop applications and
		softwares along with contributing in a way that positively impacts the organization.
